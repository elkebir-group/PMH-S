The script [run_dp.sh](run_dp.sh) runs the FPT algorithm for all simulated instances. The script [run_ilp.sh](run_ilp.sh) runs the ILP algorithm for all simulated instances. Please see the [MACHINA repository](https://github.com/raphael-group/machina) for instruction on compiling the ILP algorithm. Plots are generated in the Jupyter notebook [process.py.ipynb](process.py.ipynb).
